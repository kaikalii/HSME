### Description

This is an implementation of my Hyperspace Map machine learning algorithm in Rust. HSM is essentially a a concept learning algorithm that works on real values.

### How to Use

This repository contains both the HSM library as well as a testing program. To use either, you must have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) installed. After cloning the repository, you can build and run an example:

```
cargo run --release examples/concrete -t -d -p 50
```
